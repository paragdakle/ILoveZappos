# ILoveZappos
Internship Challenge Application

Android application to consume Zappos Search API and show products found.

Want to know something crazy?
You can perform voice search!!! 
Just say what you want to search with the voice command show me after pressing the mic button and see the magic!

For example:
Show me shoes

Other Features:
1. Press "SURPRISE ME!" to do random search. Now it is fixed random search currently but like always leaves scope for more development.
2. Currently only one view is shown as a CardView, which can be easily replaced with a RecyclerView to show all products.
3. Currently add to card can be done only once and quantity 1 is assumed. This can be easily replaced in future.

Points to think on:
1. Currently due to inavailability of any API documentation, scope of product could not be expanded as many fields from the response could not be explored.
2. More information regarding a product should be provided like ratings, likes, etc.

Well besides me there were many contributors to the project:
1. Jack Wang for his awesome loading view android [library](https://github.com/81813780/AVLoadingIndicatorView)
2. [Roundicons](http://www.flaticon.com/authors/roundicons) for the awesome cart icons.
3. [Freepik](http://www.flaticon.com/authors/freepik) for the cool mic icon.
